## Description

`django-composition` provides the abstract way to denormalize data from your models in simple declarative way through special generic model field called `CompositionField`.

Most cases of data denormalization are pretty common so `django-composition` has several "short-cuts" fields that handles most of them.

## Base concept

`CompositionField` is django model field that provides interface to data denormalization.


`CompositionField` constructor params:
                 * native - Django field instance for current compostion field
                 * trigger - one or some numberr of triggers that handle composition.
                    Trigger is a dict with allowed keys:
                      * on - signal or list of signals that this field handles
                      * do - signals handler, with 3 params:
                               * related instance
                               * instance (that comes with signal send)
                               * concrete signal (one from `on` value)
                      * field_holder_getter - function that gets instance(that comes with signal send)\
                                              as parameter and returns field holder
                                              object (related instance)
                      * sender - signal sender
                      * sender_model - model instance or model name that send signal
                      * commit - flag that indicates save instance after trigger appliance or not
                 * commons - a trigger like field with common settings
                             for all given triggers
                 * update_method - dict for customization of update_method. Allowed params:
                        * initial - initial value to field before applince of method
                        * do - index of update trigger or trigger itself
                        * queryset - query set or callable(with one param - `instance` of an holder model)
                                that have to retun something iterable
                        * name - custom method name instead of `update_FOO`
